# iOSSecureFieldv1 

This project demonstrates the use of SwiftUI's SecureField component for handling sensitive information input, such as passwords, in a simple mock application.

## Description

The application includes three screens:

- **Username/Password:** Allows users to input a username and password, then displays the submitted information securely.
- **Email/Pin:** Similar to Username/Password but designed for a different use case (e.g., email and PIN).
- **Phone Number:** Enables users to input a phone number, displaying the submitted data securely.

This project aims to showcase the SecureField component's functionality in SwiftUI for handling sensitive information securely.
